// The render engine is the @graphlearning/flow package, not a local folder. `dedupe` keeps a single
// copy of react / react-dom / @xyflow/react across this app and the package — the gotcha that bites
// when two React copies meet (invalid-hook-call). The package declares them as peer deps and
// externalises them, so it never carries its own React; dedupe is the belt to that braces.
// jsx is automatic by default with @vitejs/plugin-react.
//
// `base` is the Pages path: the site is served at graphl.in/apache-spark/ (the slug the ui-graphl
// catalog card already points at), so the build must be prefixed while dev stays at the root.
